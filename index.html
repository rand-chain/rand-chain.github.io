    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      We present RandChain, a new family of decentralised randomness beacon (DRB) protocol. Unlike existing DRB
      protocols where nodes are collaborative, i.e., contributing local entropy and aggregating them to a single output,
      nodes in RandChain are competitive: nodes compete with each other on becoming the next leader, who solely prepares
      and proposes the next random output. RandChain employs Sequential Proof-of-Work (SeqPoW), a Proof-of-Work (PoW)
      puzzle that cannot be solved faster by using multiple processors in parallel. To propose a random output, a node
      needs to solve a SeqPoW puzzle derived from the last random output and the node’s identity. Nodes execute Nakamoto
      consensus to agree on a unique vector of random outputs. RandChain achieves promising security and performance
      without relying on strong assumptions. With Nakamoto consensus, RandChain does not rely on trustworthy leaders or
      lock-step synchrony, and achieves linear communication complexity. Biasing or predicting future random outputs is
      infeasible, as nodes cannot choose their own SeqPoW inputs and SeqPoW solutions are unpredictable. Also,
      RandChain, for the first time, achieves non-parallelisable mining, where each node can only use a single processor
      to mine.

      <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Randomness enables and secures various blockchain protocols and applications, e.g., shard validator selection in
        ETH 2.0, Zcash trusted
        setup, and Single
        secret leader election. DRB allows a group of nodes to generate random
        outputs periodically. It has been a promising solution to provide secure and verifiable randomness, and is seen
        as one of the fundamental infrastructures for Blockchain. For example, Polkadot has an embedded randomness
        beacon for supporting parachain validator election, DeFi games and various protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most existing DRB protocols (e.g., ETH 2.0's beacon chain, Drand, Dfinity randomness beacon and
        Ouroboros) are constructed from periodically executing a single-shot
        Distributed Randomness Generation (DRG) protocol, where nodes sample some local entropy and collectively combine
        them to a unique random output. Such design incurs two limitations, namely

      <ul>
        <li>Lock-step synchrony: Nodes have to keep executing the same round of the protocol, otherwise the protocol
          may stall forever.</li>
        <li>High communication complexity: The all-to-all broadcast process leads to at least quadratic communication
          complexity, which is impossible to overcome without a leader.</li>
      </ul>

      Due to these two limitations, such DRG-based DRBs cannot scale. To address them, most existing DRBs have to
      employ a leader (aka dealer) who announces the round number and relays messages for all nodes. The leader then
      becomes a centralised trustworthy component and can be a single point of failure, making such DRBs unsuitable
      for the blockchain setting which requires minimised trust.

      <h2 id="contribution">Our contribution: RandChain</h2>
      <p>We present RandChain, a new family of decentralised randomness beacon (DRB) protocol. Unlike existing DRB
        protocols where nodes are collaborative, i.e., contributing local entropy and aggregating them to a single
        output,
        nodes in RandChain are competitive: nodes compete with each other on becoming the next leader, who solely
        prepares
        and proposes the next random output. RandChain employs Sequential Proof-of-Work (SeqPoW), a Proof-of-Work (PoW)
        puzzle that cannot be solved faster by using multiple processors in parallel. To propose a random output, a node
        needs to solve a SeqPoW puzzle derived from the last random output and the node’s identity. Nodes execute
        Nakamoto
        consensus to agree on a unique vector of random outputs.
      </p>


      <h2 id="seqpow">Sequential Proof-of-Work</h2>
      <p>
        Sequential Proof-of-Work (SeqPoW) is the key building block of RandChain. It is a PoW that cannot be solved
        faster by using multiple processors in parallel. Given an initial SeqPoW puzzle $S_0$, the prover keeps solving
        it by incrementing an ISF. Each iteration takes the last output $S_{i−1}$ as input and produces a new output
        $S_i$.
        For each output $S_i$, the prover checks whether it satisfies a difficulty parameter $T$. If yes, then $S_i$ is
        a
        valid
        solution, and the prover can generate a proof $\pi_i$ on it. Given S_i and $\pi_i$ , the verifier can check
        $S_i$'s
        correctness without solving the puzzle again.

      <h2 id="randchain">Protocol specification</h2>
      <p>
        Each block $B$ is of the format $(h^-, h, i, S, pk, \pi)$, where $h^-$ is the previous block ID, $h$ is the
        current block ID, $i$ is the SeqPoW solution index, $S$ is the SeqPoW solution, $pk$ is the public key of this
        block's creator, and $\pi$ is the proof that $S$ is a valid SeqPoW solution on input $h^-$.
        Let $H, H': \{0,1\}^* \to\{0,1\}^\kappa$ be two different hash functions.
        The ID $B.h$ and random output $B.rand$ of block $B$ are calculated as $B.h = H(pk || S)$ and $B.rand =
        H'(pk || S)$, respectively.
        Each node $p_k$ has its local view $\mathcal{C}_k$ of the blockchain.
        View $\mathcal{C}_k$ may have forks, i.e., multiple blocks are following the same block.
        RandChain applies Nakamoto consensus that, nodes always mine on the longest chain, as specified in
        $\mathsf{mainChain}(\cdot)$.
      </p>
      <p>
        Node $p_k$ runs two routines: the synchronisation routine $\mathsf{SyncRoutine}(\cdot)$ and the mining routine
        $\mathsf{MineRoutine}(\cdot)$.
        In $\mathsf{SyncRoutine}(\cdot)$, node $p_k$ synchronises its local blockchain $\mathcal{C}_k$ with other nodes.
        The synchronisation process is the same as in other blockchains: node $p_k$ keeps receiving blocks from other
        nodes, verifying them, and adding valid blocks to its local blockchain $\mathcal{C}_k$.

        In $\mathsf{MineRoutine}(\cdot)$, node $p_k$ keeps appending new blocks to the main chain $\mathcal{MC}_k$.
        In particular, node $p_k$ solves a SeqPoW puzzle $S$ derived from $\mathsf{SeqPoW.INIT}(pp, sk_k, B^-.h)$, where
        $pp$
        is the public parameter, $sk_k$ is its secret key, and $B^-.h$ is the hash of $\mathcal{MC}_k$'s last block.
        To solve puzzle $S$, node $p_k$ keeps executing $\mathsf{SeqPoW.SOLVE}(\cdot)$ until finding a solution that
        satisfies
        the difficulty.
        With a valid solution $S$, node $p_k$ constructs a block $B$ consisting of a random output, and appends $B$ to
        $\mathcal{MC}_k$.
